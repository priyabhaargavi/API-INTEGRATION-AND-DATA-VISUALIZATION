**The task involves creating a data visualization application using Python, Streamlit, and the OpenWeatherMap API. The application should retrieve the current weather data and forecast for a given location and display it in a visually appealing manner.

To begin, the environment needs to be set up by installing the required libraries, including Streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Additionally, an API key from OpenWeatherMap is obtained to access the weather data. This key is essential for sending API requests and retrieving the desired weather information.

Once the environment is set up, the next step involves retrieving the current weather data and forecast for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API. The API request is sent using the requests library, and the response is parsed into a JSON object. This object contains the weather data, which is then extracted and processed for visualization.

The retrieved weather data is then preprocessed by converting the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and extracting the relevant data points, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This preprocessing step is crucial for ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for visualization and analysis.

Finally, the preprocessed data is visualized using Streamlit, which provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the weather data. The visualization includes various charts and graphs that display the temperature, humidity, and wind speed over time, providing a clear and concise overview of the weather forecast.**
